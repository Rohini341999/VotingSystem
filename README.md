"Online Voting System" is a simple web-based online voting systems that will help our college to know student's most preferred language for software development. Online voting (also known as e-voting) is voting using electronic systems to aid casting and counting votes. Remote e-Voting is where voting is performed within the voter's sole	influence, and is not physically supervised by representatives (e.g. voting from one's personal computer, mobile phone, television via the internet (also called i-voting). Electronic voting	technology can speed the counting of ballots and can provide efficiency in statistics. In this project students have to register first by clicking on "Sign Up" button in	order to vote for their preferred development language. Once registered, they can sign in through the "Student Login page" with	their respective username and password. After successful sign in they can go to "Vote Here" tab and register their vote by selecting any one language of their choice and hitting the "Submit" button. Once done their vote will be registered. One vote per student is allowed. In "Voting Statistics" tab students can see the total number of votes received for each development language. 
Thank you!
